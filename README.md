# Splitix

This is a small C++ file splitter. It supports all file types as input. Splitting units are kB, MB and GB.  
Minimum C++ version needed: C++17

Arrow keys are used to move trough the menu.

**Important: the file extension ___NEEDS___ the `part_#` as split information! Everything in front of this part is customisable!**
